### Troubleshooting PDF to PowerPoint:

#### "poppler not found" Error (macOS/Linux):
```bash
# macOS
brew install poppler

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install poppler-utils

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install poppler-utils
```

#### "pdf2image import error" (Windows):
- Use text-based conversion instead
- Or install poppler binaries manually

#### "python-pptx not found":
```bash
pip install python-pptx
```

#### "PIL/Pillow not found":
